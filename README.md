# Project 1: Election Game

In this project, we explore solutions of the election game presented in problem sheet 2 with N players and M strategies. 

We use two computational approaches, a more complete matrix method, which extends the circles and squares method to higher dimensions, and an iterated best response method, utilising the arguments made in the proof of Nash's theorem.

The code for the matrix method can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/project_1_election_game/blob/main/matrix_method_functions.py). \\

The code for the iterative method can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/project_1_election_game/blob/main/iterative_method_functions.py).\\

The code for the results for the discrete game using matrix method can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/project_1_election_game/blob/main/matrix_method_results.ipynb).\\

The code for the results for the discrete game using iterative method can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/project_1_election_game/blob/main/iterative_method_results.ipynb).\\

The code for the results for the continuous approximation game using iterative method can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/project_1_election_game/blob/main/iterative_method_results_continuous.ipynb).
